Paragraphs:
- You're reading the documentation for an older, but still supported, version of ROS 2.
    For information on the latest version, please have a look at Jazzy.
- The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.
From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.
- Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn’t.
