Paragraphs:
- The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.
From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.
- Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn’t.
- Are you looking for documentation for a particular ROS package like MoveIt,  image_proc, or octomap? Please see ROS Index  or check out this index of per-package documentation.
