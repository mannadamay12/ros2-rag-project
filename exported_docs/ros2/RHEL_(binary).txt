All packages in theROS base variantare included, and only a subset of packages in theROS desktop variantare included.
The exact list of packages are described by the repositories listed inthis ros2.repos file.There are alsoRPM packagesavailable.System requirementsWe currently support RHEL 9 64-bit.System setupSet localeMake sure you have a locale which supportsUTF-8.
If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal likeC.
We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if you’re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.locale# check for UTF-8sudodnfinstalllangpacks-englibc-langpack-enexportLANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale# verify settingsEnable required repositoriesThe rosdep database contains packages from the EPEL and PowerTools repositories, which are not enabled by default.
They can be enabled by running:sudodnfinstall'dnf-command(config-manager)'epel-release-y
sudodnfconfig-manager--set-enabledcrbNoteThis step may be slightly different depending on the distribution you are using. Check the EPEL documentation:https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/#_quickstartInstall prerequisitesThere are a few packages that must be installed in order to get and unpack the binary release.sudodnfinstalltarbzip2wget-yInstall development tools (optional)If you are going to build ROS packages or otherwise do development, you can also install the development tools:sudodnfinstall-y\cmake\gcc-c++\git\make\patch\python3-colcon-common-extensions\python3-mypy\python3-pip\python3-pydocstyle\python3-pytest\python3-pytest-repeat\python3-pytest-rerunfailures\python3-rosdep\python3-setuptools\python3-vcstool\wget# install some pip packages needed for testing and# not available as RPMspython3-mpipinstall-U--user\flake8-blind-except==0.1.1\flake8-class-newline\flake8-deprecatedInstall ROS 2Go to thereleases pageDownload the latest package for RHEL; let’s assume that it ends up at~/Downloads/ros2-package-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2.Note: there may be more than one binary download option which might cause the file name to differ.Unpack it:mkdir-p~/ros2_jazzycd~/ros2_jazzy
tarxf~/Downloads/ros2-package-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2Install dependencies using rosdepROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated RHEL systems.
It is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages.sudodnfupdatesudorosdepinit

See theguideon how to work with multiple RMWs.Setup environmentSet up your environment by sourcing the following file.# Replace ".bash" with your shell if you're not using bash# Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh.~/ros2_jazzy/ros2-linux/setup.bashTry some examplesIn one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++talker:.~/ros2_jazzy/ros2-linux/setup.bash
ros2rundemo_nodes_cpptalkerIn another terminal source the setup file and then run a Pythonlistener:.~/ros2_jazzy/ros2-linux/setup.bash
ros2rundemo_nodes_pylistenerYou should see thetalkersaying that it’sPublishingmessages and thelistenersayingIheardthose messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!Next stepsContinue with thetutorials and demosto configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.TroubleshootTroubleshooting techniques can be foundhere.UninstallIf you installed your workspace with colcon as instructed above, “uninstalling” could be just a matter of opening a new terminal and not sourcing the workspace’ssetupfile.
This way, your environment will behave as though there is no Jazzy install on your system.If you’re also trying to free up space, you can delete the entire workspace directory with:rm-rf~/ros2_jazzy
