DistributionsWhat is a Distribution?A ROS distribution is a versioned set of ROS packages.
These are akin to Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu).
The purpose of the ROS distributions is to let developers work against a relatively stable codebase until they are ready to roll everything forward.
Therefore once a distribution is released, we try to limit changes to bug fixes and non-breaking improvements for the core packages (every thing under ros-desktop-full).
That generally applies to the whole community, but for “higher” level packages, the rules are less strict, and so it falls to the maintainers of a given package to avoid breaking changes.List of DistributionsBelow is a list of current and historic ROS 2 distributions.

It is described inREP 2002and was first introduced in June 2020.The Rolling distribution of ROS 2 serves two purposes:it is a staging area for future stable distributions of ROS 2, andit is a collection of the most recent development releases.As the name implies, Rolling is continuously updated andcan have in-place updates that include breaking changes.
We recommend that most people use the most recent stable distribution instead (seeList of Distributions).Packages released into the Rolling distribution will be automatically released into future stable distributions of ROS 2.Releasing a ROS 2 packageinto the Rolling distribution follows the same procedures as all other ROS 2 distributions.
