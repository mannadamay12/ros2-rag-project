In addition to creating binaries, it will also test pull requests by compiling and running all the tests for your ROS packages before the PR is merged.There are four prerequisites.The GitHub user@ros-pull-request-buildermust have access to the repository.The GitHub repository must have the webhooks set up.Your package must be indexed in rosdistroThetest_pull_requestsflag must be true.GitHub AccessYou can give access to the PR Builder either at the GitHub organization level OR just to the single GitHub repository.GitHub OrganizationOpenhttps://github.com/orgs/%YOUR_ORG%/people(while replacing%YOUR_ORG%with the appropriate organization)ClickInviteMemberand enterros-pull-request-builderGitHub RepositoryOpenhttps://github.com/%YOUR_ORG%/%YOUR_REPO%/settings/access(while replacing%YOUR_ORG%/%YOUR_REPO$with the appropriate organization/repo)ClickAddpeopleand enterros-pull-request-builderSelectAdminorWritefor their role.
