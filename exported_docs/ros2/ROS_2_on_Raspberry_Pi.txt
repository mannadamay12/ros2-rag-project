ROS 2 on Raspberry PiROS 2 is supported on both 32 bit (arm32) and 64 bit (arm64) ARM processors.
However, you can seeherethat arm64 receives Tier 1 support, while arm32 is Tier 3.
Tier 1 support means distribution specific packages and binary archives are available, while Tier 3 requires the user to compile ROS 2 from source.The fastest and simplest way to use ROS 2 is to use a Tier 1 supported configuration.This would mean either installing 64 bit Ubuntu on to the Raspberry Pi, or using the 64 bit version of Raspberry Pi OS and running ROS 2 in Docker.Ubuntu Linux on Raspberry Pi with binary ROS 2 installUbuntu for Raspberry Pi is availablehere.Make sure to confirm that you have selected the correct version as described inREP-2000.You can now install ROS 2 using the normal binary installation instructions for Ubuntu Linux.Raspberry Pi OS with ROS 2 in dockerRaspberry Pi OS 64 bit version isavailable here.Raspberry Pi OS is based on Debian which receives Tier 3 support, but it can run Ubuntu docker containers for Tier 1 support.After flashing the OS,install Docker.The official ROS 2 Docker images can be foundhere.You may choose from ros-core, ros-base, or perception. Seeherefor more information on these variants.Fetch and run an image:dockerpullros:jazzy-ros-core
dockerrun-it--rmros:jazzy-ros-coreYou can also build images yourself:Clone thedocker_images git repoonto the Raspberry Pi, change in to the directory linked above, then to the directory with your preferred variant.Inside of the directory, build the container with:dockerbuild-tros_docker.On a supported system it will only take a minute or two to build the docker containers, as the source code is already built in to binaries.

Code Examples:

Language: unknown
dockerpullros:jazzy-ros-core
dockerrun-it--rmros:jazzy-ros-core

Language: unknown
dockerbuild-tros_docker.
