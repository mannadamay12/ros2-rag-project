Beta 2 (r2b2)Table of ContentsSupported PlatformsFeaturesImprovements since Beta 1 releaseNew demo applicationSelected features from previous Alpha/Beta releasesKnown issuesSupported PlatformsWe support ROS 2 Beta 2 on three platforms: Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), macOS 10.12 (Sierra), and Windows 10.
We provide both binary packages and instructions for how to compile from source for all 3 platforms (seeinstall instructionsas well asdocumentation).FeaturesImprovements since Beta 1 releaseDDS_Security support (aka SROS2, seesros2)Debian packages for Ubuntu XenialTypesupport has been redesigned so that you only build a single executable and can choose one of the available RMW implementations by setting an environment variable (seedocumentation).Namespace support for nodes and topics (seedesign article, see known issues below).A set of command-line tools using the extensibleros2command (seeconceptual article).A set of macros for logging messages in C / C++ (see API docs ofrcutils).New demo applicationTurtlebot 2 demosusing the following repositories that have been (partially) converted to ROS 2 (Linux only):ros_astra_cameradepthimage_to_laserscanpcl_conversionscartographercartographer_rosceres-solvernavigationteleop_twist_keyboardjoystick_driversteleop_twist_joyDummy_robot demo:robot_modelrobot_state_publisherSelected features from previous Alpha/Beta releasesFor the complete list, seeearlier release notes.C++ and Python implementations of ROS 2 client libraries including APIs for:Publishing and subscribing to ROS topicsRequesting and replying ROS services (synchronous (C++ only) and asynchronous)Getting and setting ROS parameters (C++ only, synchronous and asynchronous)Timer callbacksSupport for interoperability between multiple DDS/RTPS implementationseProsima Fast RTPS is our default implementation, and is included in the binary packagesRTI Connext is supported: build from source to try it outWe initially supported PrismTech OpenSplice but support for it is currently on holdA graph API for network eventsDistributed discoveryRealtime safe code paths for publish and subscribe with compatible DDS implementation (only Connext at the moment)Support for custom allocatorsROS 1 <-> ROS 2 dynamic bridge nodeExecutor threading model (C++ only)Component model to compose nodes at compile / link / runtimeManaged component using a standard lifecycleExtended.msgformat with new features:Bounded arraysDefault valuesKnown issuesWe’re tracking issues in various repositories, but the main entry point is theros2/ros2 issue trackerWe’d like to highlight aknown issuethat we are looking into which doesn’t allow two topics with the same base name but different namespaces to have a different type when usingrmw_connext_cpp.Services with long responses are not working with Fast-RTPS. The fix, while not being part of beta2, is available upstream so you can work around this issue by building from source using Fast-RTPS master branch.
