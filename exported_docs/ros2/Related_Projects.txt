Related ProjectsGazeboGazebo(gazebosim.org)and its predecessor Gazebo Classic are the first open source choice for 3D physics simulation of ROS-based robots.Large Community ProjectsLarge community projects involve multiple developers from all over the globe and are typically backed by a dedicated working group (cf.Project Governance).ros2_control(control.ros.org): Flexible framework for real-time control of robots implemented with ROS 2.Navigation2(nav2.org): Comprehensive and flexible navigation stack for mobile robots using ROS 2.MoveIt(moveit.ai): A rich platform for building manipulation applications featuring advanced kinematics, motion planning, control, collision checking, and much more.micro-ROS(micro.ros.org): A platform for putting ROS 2 onto microcontrollers, starting at less than 100 kB of RAM.Further Community ProjectsThe global ROS community develops and maintains hundreds of further packages on top of the core ROS 2 stack.
Some of them come with their own websites for documentation.
Your best entry point to discover these works is theROS Index(index.ros.org).Hint for developers:If you maintain aREADME.mdfile in the root of your package folder (which is not necessarily the root of your repository), this file is rendered into the overview page of your package atindex.ros.org.
The file may be used for documenting your package and supersedes the package documentation pages in the ROS Wiki from ROS 1.
