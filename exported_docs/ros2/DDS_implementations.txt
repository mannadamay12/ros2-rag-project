--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DDS implementationsBy default, ROS 2 uses DDS as itsmiddleware.
It is compatible with multiple DDS or RTPS (the DDS wire protocol) vendors.
There is currently support for eProsima’s Fast DDS, RTI’s Connext DDS, Eclipse Cyclone DDS, and GurumNetworks GurumDDS.
Seehttps://ros.org/reps/rep-2000.htmlfor supported DDS vendors by distribution.The default DDS vendor is eProsima’s Fast DDS.Working with Eclipse Cyclone DDSexplains how to utilize Cyclone DDS.Working with eProsima Fast DDSexplains how to utilize Fast DDS.Working with GurumNetworks GurumDDSexplains how to utilize GurumDDS.If you would like to use one of the other vendors you will need to install their software separately before building.
The ROS 2 build will automatically build support for vendors that have been installed and sourced correctly.Once you’ve installed a new DDS vendor, you can change the vendor used at runtime:Working with Multiple RMW Implementations.Detailed instructions for installing other DDS vendors are provided below.Platforms / Installation typesUbuntu Linux source installUbuntu Linux binary installOSX source installOSX binary installWindows source installWindows binary installUbuntu Linux source installRTI Connext (version 6.0.1, amd64 only)Deb packages provided in the ROS 2 apt repositoriesYou can install a deb package of RTI Connext available on the ROS 2 apt repositories.
You will need to accept a license from RTI.sudoaptupdate&&sudoaptinstall-q-yrti-connext-dds-6.0.1Source the setup file to set theNDDSHOMEenvironment variable.cd/opt/rti.com/rti_connext_dds-6.0.1/resource/scripts&&source./rtisetenv_x64Linux4gcc7.3.0.bash;cd-Note: when usingzshyou need to be in the directory of the script when sourcing it to have it work properlyNow you can build as normal and support for RTI will be built as well.Official binary packages from RTIYou can install the Connext 6.0.1 package for Linux provided by RTI, via options available foruniversity, purchase or evaluationAfter downloading, usechmod+xon the.runexecutable and then execute it.
Note that if you’re installing to a system directory usesudoas well.The default location is~/rti_connext_dds-6.0.1After installation, run RTI launcher and point it to your license file (obtained from RTI).Add the following line to your.bashrcfile pointing to your copy of the license.exportRTI_LICENSE_FILE=path/to/rti_license.datSource the setup file to set theNDDSHOMEenvironment variable.cd~/rti_connext_dds-6.0.1/resource/scripts&&source./rtisetenv_x64Linux4gcc7.3.0.bash;cd-Now you can build as normal and support for RTI will be built as well.Ubuntu Linux binary installRTI Connext (version 6.0.1, amd64 only)To use RTI Connext DDS there are full-suite install options available foruniversity, purchase or evaluationor you can install a libraries-only deb package of RTI Connext 6.0.1, available from the OSRF Apt repository
under anon-commercial license.To install the libs-only deb package:sudoaptupdate&&sudoaptinstall-q-yrti-connext-dds-6.0.1You will need to accept a license agreement from RTI, and will find an ‘rti_license.dat file in the installation.Add the following line to your.bashrcfile pointing to your copy of the license (and source it).exportRTI_LICENSE_FILE=path/to/rti_license.datAll options need you to source the setup file to set theNDDSHOMEenvironment variable:cd/opt/rti.com/rti_connext_dds-6.0.1/resource/scripts&&source./rtisetenv_x64Linux4gcc7.3.0.bash;cd-Note: the above may need modification to match your RTI installation locationIf you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer tothis page.OSX source installRTI Connext (6.0.1)If you would like to also build against RTI Connext DDS there are options available foruniversity, purchase or evaluationYou also need a Java runtime installed to run the RTI code generator, which you can gethere.After installing, run RTI launcher and point it to your license file.Source the setup file to set theNDDSHOMEenvironment variable before building your workspace.source/Applications/rti_connext_dds-6.0.1/resource/scripts/rtisetenv_x64Darwin17clang9.0.bashYou may need to increase shared memory resources followinghttps://community.rti.com/kb/osx510If you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer tothis page.OSX binary installEnable Connext supportTo use RTI Connext DDS there are options available foruniversity, purchase or evaluationAfter installing, run RTI launcher and point it to your license file.Source the setup file to set theNDDSHOMEenvironment variable before building your workspace.source/Applications/rti_connext_dds-6.0.1/resource/scripts/rtisetenv_x64Darwin17clang9.0.bashYou may need to increase shared memory resources followinghttps://community.rti.com/kb/osx510.If you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer tothis page.Windows source installRTI Connext 6.0.1If you would like to also build against RTI Connext DDS there are options available foruniversity, purchase or evaluationAfter installing, use the RTI Launcher to load your license file.Then before building ROS 2, set up the Connext environment:call"C:\Program Files\rti_connext_dds-6.0.1\resource\scripts\rtisetenv_x64Win64VS2017.bat"Note that this path might need to be slightly altered depending on where you selected to install RTI Connext DDS, and which version of Visual Studio was selected.
The path above is the current default path as of version 6.0.1, but will change as the version numbers increment in the future.If you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer tothis page.Windows binary installRTI ConnextTo use RTI Connext DDS there are options available foruniversity, purchase or evaluationAfter installing, run RTI launcher and point it to your license file.Then before using ROS 2, set up the Connext environment:call"C:\Program Files\rti_connext_dds-6.0.1\resource\scripts\rtisetenv_x64Win64VS2017.bat"If you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer tothis page.
