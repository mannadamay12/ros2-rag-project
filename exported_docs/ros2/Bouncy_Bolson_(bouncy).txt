Bouncy Bolson (bouncy)Table of ContentsSupported PlatformsFeaturesNew features in this ROS 2 releaseChanges since the Ardent releaseKnown IssuesBouncy Bolsonis the second release of ROS 2.Supported PlatformsThis version of ROS 2 is supported on four platforms (seeREP 2000for full details):Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)Debian packages for amd64 as well as arm64Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)no Debian packages but building from source is supportedMac macOS 10.12 (Sierra)Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2017Binary packages as well as instructions for how to compile from source are provided (seeinstall instructionsas well asdocumentation).FeaturesNew features in this ROS 2 releaseNew launch systemfeaturing a much more capable and flexible Python API.Parameters can be passed ascommand line argumentsto C++ executables.Static remapping viacommand line arguments.Various improvements to the Python client library.Support for publishing and subscribing to serialized data.
This is the foundation for the upcoming work towards a native rosbag implementation.Morecommand line tools, e.g. for working with parameters and lifecycle states.Binary packages / fat archives support three RMW implementations by default (without the need to build from source):eProsima’s Fast RTPS (default)RTI’s ConnextADLINK’s OpenSpliceFor an overview of all features available, including those from earlier releases, please see theFeaturespage.Changes since the Ardent releaseChanges since theArdent Apalonerelease:The Python packagelaunchhas been redesigned.
The previous Python API has been moved into a submodulelaunch.legacy.
You can update existing launch files to continue to use the legacy API if a transition to the new Python API is not desired.The ROS topic names containing namespaces are mapped to DDS topics including their namespaces.
DDS partitions are not being used anymore for this.The recommended build tool is nowcolconinstead ofament_tools.
This switch has noimplicationsfor the code in each ROS 2 package.
The install instructions have been updated and theread-the-docs pagedescribes how to map an existingament_toolscall tocolcon.The argument order ofthis rclcpp::Node::create_subscription() signaturehas been modified.Known IssuesNew-style launch filesmay hang on shutdownfor some combinations of platform and RMW implementation.Static remapping of namespacesnot working correctlywhen addressed to a particular node.Opensplice error messages may be printedwhen usingros2paramandros2lifecyclecommand-line tools.
