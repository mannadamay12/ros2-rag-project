Maintain source checkoutNoteFor instructions on maintaining a source checkout of thelatest development versionof ROS 2, refer toMaintaining a source checkout of ROS 2 RollingUpdate your repository listLatest ROS 2 Jazzy branchesUpdate your repositoriesDownload the new source codeRebuild your workspaceInspect your source checkoutIf you have installed ROS 2 from source, there may have been changes made to the source code since the time that you checked it out.
To keep your source checkout up to date, you will have to periodically update yourros2.reposfile, download the latest sources, and rebuild your workspace.Update your repository listEach ROS 2 release includes aros2.reposfile that contains the list of repositories and their version for that release.Latest ROS 2 Jazzy branchesIf you wish to checkout the latest code for ROS 2 Jazzy, you can get the relevant repository list by running:LinuxmacOSWindowscd~/ros2_jazzy
mv-iros2.reposros2.repos.old
wgethttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/jazzy/ros2.reposcd~/ros2_jazzy
mv-iros2.reposros2.repos.old
wgethttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/jazzy/ros2.repos# CMDcd\dev\ros2_jazzy
curl-skhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/jazzy/ros2.repos-oros2.repos# PowerShellcd\dev\ros2_jazzy

It is possible that these versions refer to new tags/branches that your local copy of the repositories will not recognize as they are out-of-date.
Because of this, you should update the repositories that you have already checked out with the following command:vcscustom--argsremoteupdateDownload the new source codeYou should now be able to download the sources associated with the new repository list with:LinuxmacOSWindowsvcsimportsrc<ros2.repos
vcspullsrcvcsimportsrc<ros2.repos
vcspullsrc# CMDvcsimportsrc<ros2.repos
vcspullsrc# PowerShellvcsimport--inputros2.repossrc
vcspullsrcRebuild your workspaceNow that the workspace is up to date with the latest sources, remove your previous install and rebuild your workspace with, for example:colconbuild--symlink-installInspect your source checkoutDuring your development you may have deviated from the original state of your workspace from when you imported the repository list.
If you wish to know the versions of the set of repositories in your workspace, you can export the information using the following command:LinuxmacOSWindowscd~/ros2_jazzy
vcsexportsrc>my_ros2.reposcd~/ros2_jazzy
vcsexportsrc>my_ros2.reposcd\dev\ros2_jazzy
vcsexportsrc>my_ros2.reposThismy_ros2.reposfile can then be shared with others so that they can reproduce the state of the repositories in your workspace.
