ROS 2 DocumentationThe Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn’t.Are you looking for documentation for a particular ROS package like MoveIt,  image_proc, or octomap?Please seeROS Indexor check outthis index of per-package documentation.This site contains the documentation for ROS 2.
If you are looking for ROS 1 documentation, check out theROS wiki.If you use ROS 2 in your work, please seeCitationsto cite ROS 2.Getting startedInstallationInstructions to set up ROS 2 for the first timeTutorialsThe best place to start for new users!Hands-on sample projects that help you build a progression of necessary skillsHow-to GuidesQuick answers to your “How do I…?” questions without working through theTutorialsConceptsHigh-level explanations of core ROS 2 concepts covered in theTutorialsContactAnswers to your questions or a forum to start a discussionThe ROS 2 projectIf you’re interested in the advancement of the ROS 2 project:ContributingBest practices and methodology for contributing to ROS 2, as well as instructions for migrating existing ROS 1 content to ROS 2DistributionsPast, present and future ROS 2 distributionsFeatures StatusFeatures in the current releaseFeature IdeasIdeas for nice-to-have features that are not under active developmentRoadmapPlanned work for ROS 2 developmentROSCon TalksPresentations by the community on ROS 2Project GovernanceInformation about the ROS Technical Steering Committee, Working Groups, and upcoming eventsMarketingDownloadable marketing materialsInformation about the ROS trademarkROS community resourcesIf you need help, have an idea, or would like to contribute to the project, please visit our ROS community resources.Official ROS Discord Channel for discussion and support(ROS 1, ROS 2)Robotics Stack Exchange - community Q&A website(ROS 1, ROS 2)SeeContact Pagefor more informationROS Discourse(ROS 1, ROS 2)Forum for general discussions and announcements for the ROS communitySee theContact Pagefor more informationROS Index(ROS 1, ROS 2)Indexed list of all packages (i.e.Python Package Index (PyPI)for ROS packages)See which ROS distributions a package supportsLink to a package’s repository, API documentation, or websiteInspect a package’s license, build type, maintainers, status, and dependenciesGet more info for a package onRobotics Stack ExchangeROS resource status page(ROS 1, ROS 2)Check the current status of ROS resources like Discourse or the ROS build farm.General ROS project resourcesROS Enhancement Proposals (REPs)(ROS 1, ROS 2)Proposals for new designs and conventionsROS Robots(ROS 1, ROS 2)Showcases robots projects from the communityInstructions on how to contribute a robotROS Wiki(ROS 1)ROS 1 documentation and user modifiable contentActive until at least the last ROS 1 distribution is EOLROS.org(ROS 1, ROS 2)ROS 1 and ROS 2 product landing page, with high-level description of ROS and links to other ROS sitesEventsOfficial ROS Vimeo Channel(ROS 1, ROS 2)Videos of ROSCon Talks, community and working group meetings, and project demos.ROSCon website(ROS 1, ROS 2)ROSCon is our annual ROS developer conference.This page also lists regional ROS events like ROSConJP and ROSConFr.Open Source Robotics Foundation official events calendarThis calendar is for official OSRF Events and working group meetings.Submit your events here.Open Source Robotics Foundation community calendarThis calendar is for unofficial ROS community events.Submit your events here.MiscellaneousPurchase official ROS swagROS on social media@OpenRoboticsOrgand@ROSOrgon TwitterOpen Robotics on LinkedInVisit theOpen Source Robotics Foundation websiteTax deductible charitable donations to the Open Source Robotics Foundation can be sent viaDonorBox.DeprecatedROS 2 DesignEarly design decisions behind ROS 2 developmentNew design proposals should be submitted viaROS Enhancement Proposals (REPs)
