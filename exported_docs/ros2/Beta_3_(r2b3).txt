Beta 3 (r2b3)Table of ContentsSupported PlatformsFeaturesImprovements since Beta 2 releaseNew demo applicationSelected features from previous Alpha/Beta releasesKnown issuesSupported PlatformsWe support ROS 2 Beta 3 on three platforms: Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), macOS 10.12 (Sierra), and Windows 10.
We provide both binary packages and instructions for how to compile from source for all 3 platforms (seeinstall instructionsas well asdocumentation).FeaturesImprovements since Beta 2 releaseExecution model in Python, many fixes to memory management in Python C extensionExperimental rewrite ofros_controlExposure of DDS implementation-specific symbols to users (for Fast RTPS and Connext) (seeexample)LoggingAPIin PythonFixed several memory leaks and race conditions in various packagesReadded support for OpenSplice (on Linux and Windows atm) provided by PrismTechUse bloom (without patches) to make ROS 2 releasesNew demo applicationHSR demoRemote control a HSR robot using a ROS 2 joystick controllerRunning theros1_bridgein a Docker container on the HSR (since the robot is running ROS 1 on Ubuntu Trusty)Run a ROS 2 development version ofrvizto visualize sensor data from the robot etc. (seevideo)Selected features from previous Alpha/Beta releasesFor the complete list, seeearlier release notes.C++ and Python implementations of ROS 2 client libraries including APIs for:Publishing and subscribing to ROS topicsRequesting and replying ROS services (synchronous (C++ only) and asynchronous)Getting and setting ROS parameters (C++ only, synchronous and asynchronous)Timer callbacksSupport for interoperability between multiple DDS/RTPS implementationseProsima Fast RTPS is our default implementation, and is included in the binary packagesRTI Connext is supported: build from source to try it outPrismTech OpenSplice: see limitations belowA graph API for network eventsDistributed discoveryRealtime safe code paths for publish and subscribe with compatible DDS implementation (only Connext at the moment)Support for custom allocatorsROS 1 <-> ROS 2 dynamic bridge nodeExecutor threading model (C++ and Python)Component model to compose nodes at compile / link / runtimeManaged component using a standard lifecycleExtended.msgformat with new features:Bounded arraysDefault valuesKnown issuesOn Windows Python launch files might hang when trying to abort usingCtrl-C(seeissue). In order to continue using the shell which is blocked by the hanging command you might want to end the hanging Python process using the process monitor.OpenSplice support is currently not available for MacOS. Alsoaccess to native handlesis not yet implemented.Using Connext it is currently not allowed for two topics with the same base name but different namespaces to have a different type (seeissue).
