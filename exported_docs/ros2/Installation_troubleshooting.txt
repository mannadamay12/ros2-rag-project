Installation troubleshootingTroubleshooting techniques for installation are sorted by the platforms they apply to.PlatformsGeneralLinuxmacOSWindowsGeneralGeneral troubleshooting techniques apply to all platforms.Enable multicastIn order to communicate successfully via DDS, the used network interface has to be multicast enabled.
We’ve seen in past experiences that this might not necessarily be enabled by default (on Ubuntu or OSX) when using the loopback adapter.
See theoriginal issueor aconversation on ros-answers.
You can verify that your current setup allows multicast with the ROS 2 tool:In Terminal 1:ros2multicastreceiveIn Terminal 2:ros2multicastsendIf the first command did not return a response similar to:Receivedfromxx.xxx.xxx.xx:43751:'Hello World!'then you will need to update your firewall configuration to allow multicast usingufw.sudoufwallowinprotoudpto224.0.0.0/4
sudoufwallowinprotoudpfrom224.0.0.0/4You can check if the multicast flag is enabled for your network interface using theifconfigtool and looking forMULITCASTin the flags section:eno1:flags=4163<...,MULTICAST>...Import failing without library present on the systemSometimesrclpyfails to be imported because the expected C extension libraries are not found.
If so, compare the libraries present in the directory with the one mentioned in the error message.
Assuming a file with a similar name exists (same prefix like_rclpy.and same suffix like.sobut a different Python version / architecture) you are using a different Python interpreter than which was used to build the C extension.
Be sure to use the same Python interpreter as the one used to build the binary.For example, such a mismatch can crop up after an update of the OS. Then, rebuilding the workspace may fix the issue.LinuxInternal compiler errorIf you experience an ICE when trying to compile on a memory constrained platform like a Raspberry PI you might want to build single threaded (prefix the build invocation withMAKEFLAGS=-j1).Out of memoryTheros1_bridgein its current form requires 4Gb of free RAM to compile.
If you don’t have that amount of RAM available it’s suggested to useCOLCON_IGNOREin that folder and skip its compilation.Multiple host interferenceIf you’re running multiple instances on the same network you may get interference.
To avoid this you can set the environment variableROS_DOMAIN_IDto a different integer, the default is zero.
This will define the DDS domain id for your system.Exception sourcing setup.bashIf you encounter exceptions when trying to source the environment after building from source, try to upgradecolconrelated packages usingcolconversion-check# check if newer versions availablesudoaptinstallpython3-colcon*--only-upgrade# upgrade installed colcon packages to latest versionAnaconda Python Conflictcondadoes not work in conjunction with ROS 2.
Make sure that yourPATHenvironment variable does not have any conda paths in it.
You may have to check your.bashrcfor this line and comment it out.Cannot start rviz2rviz2may fail to start on a Wayland display system with errors like:QSocketNotifier:CanonlybeusedwiththreadsstartedwithQThread[INFO][1714730141.758659580][rviz2]:StereoisNOTSUPPORTED[INFO][1714730141.758813709][rviz2]:OpenGlversion:3.1(GLSL1.4)[ERROR][1714730141.797879232][rviz2]:rviz::RenderSystem:errorcreatingrenderwindow:RenderingAPIException:InvalidparentWindowHandle(wrongserverorscreen)inGLXWindow::createat./.obj-aarch64-linux-gnu/ogre_vendor-prefix/src/ogre_vendor/RenderSystems/GLSupport/src/GLX/OgreGLXWindow.cpp(line246)...[ERROR][1714730141.808124283][rviz2]:Unabletocreatetherenderingwindowafter100triesterminatecalledafterthrowinganinstanceof'std::runtime_error'what():Unabletocreatetherenderingwindowafter100triesAborted(coredumped)This is due to an incompatibility between Wayland and RViz2.
You may be able to workaround this problem by running RViz2 in X11 compatibility mode:QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcbrviz2macOSSegmentation fault when usingpyenvpyenvseems to default to building Python with.afiles, but that causes issues withrclpy, so it’s recommended to build Python with Frameworks enabled on macOS when usingpyenv:https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#how-to-build-cpython-with-framework-support-on-os-xLibrary not loaded; image not foundIf you are seeing library loading issues at runtime (either running tests or running nodes), such as the following:ImportError:dlopen(.../ros2_<distro>/ros2-osx/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rclpy/_rclpy.cpython-37m-darwin.so,2):Librarynotloaded:@rpath/librcl_interfaces__rosidl_typesupport_c.dylibReferencedfrom:.../ros2_<distro>/ros2-osx/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rclpy/_rclpy.cpython-37m-darwin.soReason:imagenotfoundThen you probably have System Integrity Protection enabled.
Followthese instructionsto disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).Qt build error:unknowntypename'Q_ENUM'If you see build errors related to Qt, e.g.:Infileincludedfrom/usr/local/opt/qt/lib/QtGui.framework/Headers/qguiapplication.h:46:
/usr/local/opt/qt/lib/QtGui.framework/Headers/qinputmethod.h:87:5:error:unknowntypename'Q_ENUM'Q_ENUM(Action)^you may be using qt4 instead of qt5: seehttps://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/441Missing symbol when opencv (and therefore libjpeg, libtiff, and libpng) are installed with HomebrewIf you have opencv installed you might get this:dyld:Symbolnotfound:__cg_jpeg_resync_to_restartReferencedfrom:/System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIOExpectedin:/usr/local/lib/libJPEG.dylibin/System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO
/bin/sh:line1:25274Trace/BPTtrap:5/usr/local/bin/cmakeIf so, to build you’ll have to do this:$brewunlinklibpnglibtifflibjpegBut this will break opencv, so you’ll also need to update it to continue working:$sudoinstall_name_tool-change/usr/local/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib/usr/local/opt/jpeg/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib/usr/local/lib/libopencv_highgui.2.4.dylib

The others are updating things built by Homebrew so that they can find the version of libjpeg (etc.) without having them in /usr/local/lib.Xcode-select error: toolxcodebuildrequires Xcode, but active developer directory is a command line instanceIf you recently installed Xcode, you may encounter this error:Xcode:xcode-select:error:tool'xcodebuild'requiresXcode,
butactivedeveloperdirectory'/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools'isacommandlinetoolsinstanceTo resolve this error, you will need to:Double check that you have the command line tool installed:$xcode-select--installAccept the terms and conditions of Xcode by typing in terminal:$sudoxcodebuild-licenseacceptEnsure Xcode app is in the/Applicationsdirectory (NOT/Users/{user}/Applications)Pointxcode-selectto the Xcode app Developer directory using the following command:$sudoxcode-select-s/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developerrosdep install errorhomebrew:Failedtodetectsuccessfulinstallationof[qt5]While following theCreating a workspacetutorial, you might encounter the following error stating thatrosdepfailes to install Qt5.$rosdepinstall-i--from-pathsrc--rosdistrojazzy-y

$sudoln-sqtqt5Running therosdepcommand should now execute normally:$rosdepinstall-i--from-pathsrc--rosdistrojazzy-y#All required rosdeps installed successfullyWindowsImport failing even with library present on the systemSometimesrclpyfails to be imported because of some missing DLLs on your system.
If so, make sure to install all the dependencies listed in the “Installing prerequisites” sections of theinstallation instructions).If you are installing from binaries, you may need to update your dependencies: they must be the same version as those used to build the binaries.If you are still having issues, you can use theDependenciestool to determine which dependencies are missing on your system.
Use the tool to load the corresponding.pydfile, and it should report unavailableDLLmodules.
Be sure that the current workspace is sourced before you execute the tool, otherwise there will be unresolved ROS DLL files.
Use this information to install additional dependencies or adjust your path as necessary.CMake error setting modification timeIf you run into the CMake errorfileINSTALLcannotsetmodificationtimeon...when installing files it is likely that an anti virus software or Windows Defender are interfering with the build. E.g. for Windows Defender you can list the workspace location to be excluded to prevent it from scanning those files.260 character path limitTheinputlineistoolong.
Thesyntaxofthecommandisincorrect.Depending on your directory hierarchy, you may see path length limit errors when building ROS 2 from source or your own libraries.To allow deeper path lengths:Runregedit.exe, navigate toComputer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem, and setLongPathsEnabledto 0x00000001 (1).Hit the windows key and typeEditGroupPolicy.
Navigate to Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Filesystem.
Right clickEnableWin32longpaths, click Edit.
In the dialog, select Enabled and click OK.Close and open your terminal to reset the environment and try building again.CMake packages unable to find asio, tinyxml2, tinyxml, or eigenWe’ve seen that sometimes the chocolatey packages forasio,tinyxml2, etc. do not add important registry entries and CMake will be unable to find them when building ROS 2.
We’ve not yet been able to identify the root cause, but uninstalling the chocolatey packages (with-nif the uninstall fails the first time), and then reinstalling them will fix the issue.patch.exe opens a new command window and asks for administratorThis will also cause the build of packages which need to use patch to fail, even you allow it to use administrator rights.chocouninstallpatch;colconbuild--cmake-clean-cache- This is a bug in theGNU Patch For Windows package. If this package is not installed, the build process will instead use the version of Patch distributed with git.Failed to load Fast RTPS shared libraryFast RTPS requiresmsvcr20.dll, which is part of theVisualC++RedistributablePackagesforVisualStudio2013.
Although it is usually installed by default in Windows 10, we know that some Windows 10-like versions don’t have it installed by default (e.g.: Windows Server 2019).
In case you don’t have it installed, you can download it fromhere.Failed to create processIf running a ROS binary gives the error:|failedtocreateprocess.It is likely the Python interpreter was not found.
For each executable, the shebang (first line) of the accompanying script is used, so make sure Python is available under the expected path (default:C:\Python38\).Binary installation specificIf your example does not start because of missing DLLs, please verify that all libraries from external dependencies such as OpenCV are located inside yourPATHvariable.If you forget to call thelocal_setup.batfile from your terminal, the demo programs will most likely crash immediately.Running RViz with WSL2If you are usingWSL2to run ROS 2 on Windows, you may run into an issue running RViz that looks like:$rviz2[INFO] [1695823660.091830699] [rviz2]: Stereo is NOT SUPPORTED[INFO] [1695823660.091943524] [rviz2]: OpenGl version: 4.1 (GLSL 4.1)D3D12: Removing Device.Segmentation faultOne possible solution to this is to force RViz to use software rendering:$exportLIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true$rviz2[INFO] [1695823660.091830699] [rviz2]: Stereo is NOT SUPPORTED
