Overview and usage of RQtTable of ContentsOverviewSystem setupInstalling From debsRQt Components StructureAdvantage of RQt frameworkFurther ReadingOverviewRQt is a graphical user interface framework that implements various tools and interfaces in the form of plugins.
One can run all the existing GUI tools as dockable windows within RQt.
The tools can still run in a traditional standalone method, but RQt makes it easier to manage all the various windows in a single screen layout.You can run any RQt tools/plugins easily by:rqtThis GUI allows you to choose any available plugins on your system.
You can also run plugins in standalone windows.
For example, RQt Python Console:ros2runrqt_py_consolerqt_py_consoleUsers can create their own plugins for RQt with eitherPythonorC++.
To see what RQt plugins are available for your system, run:ros2pkglistAnd then look for packages that start withrqt_.System setupInstalling From debssudoaptinstallros-jazzy-rqt*RQt Components StructureRQt consists of two metapackages:rqt- core infrastucture modules.rqt_common_plugins- Commonly useful debugging tools.Advantage of RQt frameworkCompared to building your own GUIs from scratch:Standardized common procedures for GUI (start-shutdown hook, restore previous states).Multiple widgets can be docked in a single window.Easily turn your existing Qt widgets into RQt plugins.Expect support atRobotics Stack Exchange(ROS community website for the questions).From system architecture’s perspective:Support multi-platform (basically whereverQTand ROS run) and multi-language (Python,C++).Manageable lifecycle: RQt plugins using a common API makes maintainance & reuse easier.Further ReadingROS 2 Discourseannouncement of porting to ROS 2)RQt for ROS 1 documentationBrief overview of RQt (froma Willow Garage intern blog post)
