NodesA node is a participant in the ROS 2 graph, which uses aclient libraryto communicate with other nodes.
Nodes can communicate with other nodes within the same process, in a different process, or on a different machine.
Nodes are typically the unit of computation in a ROS graph; each node should do one logical thing.Nodes canpublishto named topics to deliver data to other nodes, orsubscribeto named topics to get data from other nodes.
They can also act as aservice clientto have another node perform a computation on their behalf, or as aservice serverto provide functionality to other nodes.
For long-running computations, a node can act as anaction clientto have another node perform it on their behalf, or as anaction serverto provide functionality to other nodes.
Nodes can provide configurableparametersto change behavior during run-time.Nodes are often a complex combination of publishers, subscribers, service servers, service clients, action servers, and action clients, all at the same time.Connections between nodes are established through a distributeddiscoveryprocess.
