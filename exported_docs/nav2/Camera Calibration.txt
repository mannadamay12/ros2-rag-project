## Overview
This tutorial shows how to obtain calibration parameters for monocular camera.

## Requirements
1- Install Camera Calibration Parser, Camera Info Manager and Launch Testing Ament Cmake using operating system’s package manager:
2- Image Pipeline need to be built from source in your workspace with:
Also, make sure you have the following:

## Tutorial Steps
1- Start a terminal in your GUI
2- Launch the ROS driver for your specific camera.
3- Make sure camera is publishing images over ROS. This can be tested by running:
4- This will show you all the topics published make sure that there is an image_raw topic /camera/image_raw. To confirm that its a real topic and actually publishing check topic hz:
5- Start the camera calibration node
6- In order to get a good calibration you will need to move the checkerboard around in the camera frame such that:
7- As the checkerboard is moved around the 4 bars on the calibration sidebar increases in length. When all then the 4 bars are green and enough data is available for calibration the CALIBRATE button will light up. Click it to see the results. It takes around the minute for calibration to take place.
8- After the calibration is completed the save and commit buttons light up. And you can also see the result in terminal.
9-Press the save button to see the result. Data is saved to  “/tmp/calibrationdata.tar.gz”
11-In the folder images used for calibration are available and also “ost.yaml” and “ost.txt”. You can use the yaml file which contains the calibration parameters as directed by the camera driver.
