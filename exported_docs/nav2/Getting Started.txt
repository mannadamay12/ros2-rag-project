## Installation
Jazzy introduced the new Gazebo modern simulator, replacing Gazebo Classic.
Thus, for Jazzy and newer, the installation packages and instructions are slightly different to pull in the appropriate packages.
ForJazzy and newer, install the Turtlebot 3 & 4 packages for Gazebo Modern. It should be automatically installed withnav2_bringup:
ForIron and older, install Turtlebot 3 packages for gazebo classic:

## Running the Example


## Navigating
After starting, the robot initially has no idea where it is. By default,
Nav2 waits for you to give it an approximate starting position. Take a look
at where the robot is in the Gazebo world, and find that spot on the map. Set
the initial pose by clicking the “2D Pose Estimate” button in RViz, and then
down clicking on the map in that location. You set the orientation by dragging
forward from the down click.
If you are using the defaults so far, the robot should look roughly like this.
If you don’t get the location exactly right, that’s fine. Nav2 will refine
the position as it navigates. You can also, click the “2D Pose
Estimate” button and try again, if you prefer.
Once you’ve set the initial pose, the transform tree will be complete and
Nav2 will be fully active and ready to go. You should see the robot and particle
cloud now.
Next, click the “Navigaton2 Goal” button and choose a destination.
This will call the BT navigator to go to that goal through an action server.
You can pause (cancel) or reset the action through the Nav2 rviz plugin shown.
Now watch the robot go!
