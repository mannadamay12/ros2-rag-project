## Overview
This document explains one set of methods for getting backtraces for ROS 2 and Nav2.
There are many ways to accomplish this, but this is a good starting point for new C++ developers without GDB experience.
The following steps show ROS 2 users how to modify the Nav2 stack to get traces from specific servers when they encounter a problem.
This tutorial applies to both simulated and physical robots.
This will cover how to get a backtrace from a specific node usingros2run, from a launch file representing a single node usingros2launch, and from a more complex orchestration of nodes.
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to get a backtrace when you notice a server crashing in ROS 2.

## Preliminaries
GDB is the most popular debugger for C++ on Unix systems.
It can be used to determine the reason for a crash and track threads.
It may also be used to add breakpoints in your code to check values in memory a particular points in your software.
Using GDB is a critical skill for all software developers working on C/C++.
Many IDEs will have some kind of debugger or profiler built in, but with ROS, there are few IDEs to choose.
Therefore it’s important to understand how to use these raw tools you have available rather than relying on an IDE to provide them.
Further, understanding these tools is a fundamental skill of C/C++ development and leaving it up to your IDE can be problematic if you change roles and no longer have access to it or are doing development on the fly through an ssh session to a remote asset.
Using GDB luckily is fairly simple after you have the basics under your belt.
The first step is to add-gto your compiler flags for the ROS package you want to profile / debug.
This flag builds debug symbols that GDB and valgrind can read to tell you specific lines of code in your project are failing and why.
If you do not set this flag, you can still get backtraces but it will not provide line numbers for failures.
Be sure to remove this flag after debugging, it will slow down performance at run-time.
Adding the following line to yourCMakeLists.txtfor your project should do the trick.
If your project already has aadd_compile_options(), you can simply add-gto it.
Then simply rebuild your workspace with this packagecolconbuild--packages-select<package-name>.
It may take a little longer than usual to compile.
Now you’re ready to debug your code!
If this was a non-ROS project, at this point you might do something like below.
Here we’re launching a GDB session and telling our program to immediately run.
Once your program crashes, it will return a gdb session prompt denoted by(gdb).
At this prompt you can access the information you’re interested in.
However, since this is a ROS project with lots of node configurations and other things going on, this isn’t a great option for beginners or those that don’t like tons of commandline work and understanding the filesystem.
Below are sections to describe the 3 major situations you could run into with ROS 2-based systems.
Read the section that best describes the problem you’re attempting to solve.

## From a Node
Just as in our non-ROS example, we need to setup a GDB session before launching our ROS 2 node.
While we could set this up through the commandline with some knowledge of the ROS 2 file system, we can instead use the launch--prefixoption the kind folks at Open Robotics provided for us.
--prefixwill execute some bits of code before ourros2command allowing us to insert some information.
If you attempted to dogdbexrun--argsros2run<pkg><node>as analog to our example in the preliminaries, you’d find that it couldn’t find theros2command.
If you’re even more clever, you’d find that trying to source your workspace would also fail for similar reasons.
Rather than having to revert to finding the install path of the executable and typing it all out, we can instead use--prefix.
This allows us to use the sameros2runsyntax you’re used to without having to worry about some of the GDB details.
Just as before, this prefix will launch a GDB session and run the node you requested with all the additional commandline arguments.
You should now have your node running and should be chugging along with some debug printing.
Once your server crashes, you’ll see a prompt like below. At this point you can now get a backtrace.
In this session, typebacktraceand it will provide you with a backtrace.
Copy this for your needs.
For example:
In this example you should read this in the following way, starting at the bottom:
These traces take some time to get used to reading, but in general, start at the bottom and follow it up the stack until you see the line it crashed on.
Then you can deduce why it crashed.
When you are done with GDB, typequitand it will exit the session and kill any processes still up.
It may ask you if you want to kill some threads at the end, say yes.

## From a Launch File
Just as in our non-ROS example, we need to setup a GDB session before launching our ROS 2 launch file.
While we could set this up through the commandline, we can instead make use of the same mechanics that we did in theros2runnode example, now using a launch file.
In your launch file, find the node that you’re interested in debugging.
For this section, we assume that your launch file contains only a single node (and potentially other information as well).
TheNodefunction used in thelaunch_rospackage will take in a fieldprefixtaking a list of prefix arguments.
We will insert the GDB snippet here with one change from our node example, use ofxterm.xtermwill pop up a new terminal window to show and interact with GDB.
We do this because of issues handlingstdinon launch files (e.g. if you hit control+C, are you talking to GDB or launch?).
Seethis ticketfor more information.
See below for an example debugging SLAM Toolbox.
Just as before, this prefix will launch a GDB session, now inxtermand run the launch file you requested with all the additional launch arguments defined.
Once your server crashes, you’ll see a prompt like below, now in thextermsession. At this point you can now get a backtrace.
In this session, typebacktraceand it will provide you with a backtrace.
Copy this for your needs.
See the example trace in the section above for an example.
These traces take some time to get used to reading, but in general, start at the bottom and follow it up the stack until you see the line it crashed on.
Then you can deduce why it crashed.
When you are done with GDB, typequitand it will exit the session and kill any processes still up.
It may ask you if you want to kill some threads at the end, say yes.

## From Large Project
Working with launch files with multiple nodes is a little different so you can interact with your GDB session without being bogged down by other logging in the same terminal.
For this reason, when working with larger launch files, its good to pull out the specific server you’re interested in and launching it separately.
These instructions are targeting Nav2, but are applicable to any large project with many nodes of any type in a series of launch file(s).
As such, for this case, when you see a crash you’d like to investigate, its beneficial to separate this server from the others.
If your server of interest is being launched from a nested launch file (e.g. an included launch file) you may want to do the following:
Alternatively, if you server of interest is being launched in these files directly (e.g. you see aNode,LifecycleNode, or inside aComponentContainer), you will need to separate this from the others:
Once your server crashes, you’ll see a prompt like below in the specific server’s terminal. At this point you can now get a backtrace.
In this session, typebacktraceand it will provide you with a backtrace.
Copy this for your needs.
See the example trace in the section above for an example.
These traces take some time to get used to reading, but in general, start at the bottom and follow it up the stack until you see the line it crashed on.
Then you can deduce why it crashed.
When you are done with GDB, typequitand it will exit the session and kill any processes still up.
It may ask you if you want to kill some threads at the end, say yes.

## From Nav2 Bringup
To debug directly from the nav2 bringup launch files you may want to do the following:
Once your server crashes, you’ll see a prompt like below in the xterm window. At this point you can now get a backtrace.
In this session, typebacktraceand it will provide you with a backtrace.
Copy this for your needs.
See the example trace in the section above for an example.
These traces take some time to get used to reading, but in general, start at the bottom and follow it up the stack until you see the line it crashed on.
Then you can deduce why it crashed.
When you are done with GDB, typequitand it will exit the session and kill any processes still up.
It may ask you if you want to kill some threads at the end, say yes.

## Automatic backtrace on crash
Thebackward-cpplibrary provides beautiful stack traces, and thebackward_roswrapper simplifies its integration.
Just add it as a dependency andfind_packageit in your CMakeLists and the backward libraries will be injected in all your executables and libraries.
