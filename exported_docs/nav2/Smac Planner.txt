## Provided Plugins


## Description
Thenav2_smac_plannerpackage contains an optimized templated A* search algorithm used to create multiple A*-based planners for multiple types of robot platforms. It uses template node types to develop different search-based planners.
We support circular differential-drive and omni-directional drive robots using theSmacPlanner2Dplanner which implements a cost-aware A* planner. We support car-like (ackermann) and legged vehicles using theSmacPlannerHybridplugin which implements a Hybrid-A* planner. We support non-circular, arbitrary shaped, any model vehicles using theSmacPlannerLatticeplugin which implements a State Lattice planner (e.g. omni, diff, ackermann, legged, custom). It contains control sets and generators for ackermann, legged, differential drive and omnidirectional vehicles, but you may provide your own for another robot type or to have different planning behaviors.
The last two plugins are bothkinematically feasibleand supportreversing. They have performance similar to its 2D counter parts like 2D-A* and NavFn via highly optimized heuristic functions and efficient programming. An example of the 3 planners can be seen below, planning a roughly 75 m path.
Usual planning times are below 100ms for some environments, occasionally approaching up to 200ms. The performance of all 3 planners is roughly comparable with naive 2D search algorithms that have long been mainstays of the ROS Navigation ecosystem, but also achieving kinematic feasibility, support for reversing, and using modern state of the art techniques.
