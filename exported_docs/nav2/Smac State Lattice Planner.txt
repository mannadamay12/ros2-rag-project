"nav2_smac_planner::SmacPlannerLattice"
# In Iron and older versions, "/" was used instead of "::"
allow_unknown
:
true
# Allow traveling in unknown space
tolerance
:
0.25
# dist-to-goal heuristic cost (distance) for valid tolerance endpoints if exact goal cannot be found.
max_iterations
:
1000000
# Maximum total iterations to search for before failing (in case unreachable), set to -1 to disable
max_on_approach_iterations
:
1000
# Maximum number of iterations after within tolerances to continue to try to find exact solution
max_planning_time
:
5.0
# Max time in s for planner to plan, smooth
analytic_expansion_ratio
:
3.5
# The ratio to attempt analytic expansions during search for final approach.
analytic_expansion_max_length
:
3.0
# For Hybrid/Lattice nodes The maximum length of the analytic expansion to be considered valid to prevent unsafe shortcutting
analytic_expansion_max_cost
:
200.0
# The maximum single cost for any part of an analytic expansion to contain and be valid, except when necessary on approach to goal
analytic_expansion_max_cost_override
:
false
#  Whether or not to override the maximum cost setting if within critical distance to goal (ie probably required)
reverse_penalty
:
2.0
# Penalty to apply if motion is reversing, must be => 1
change_penalty
:
0.05
# Penalty to apply if motion is changing directions (L to R), must be >= 0
non_straight_penalty
:
1.05
# Penalty to apply if motion is non-straight, must be => 1
cost_penalty
:
2.0
# Penalty to apply to higher cost areas when adding into the obstacle map dynamic programming distance expansion heuristic. This drives the robot more towards the center of passages. A value between 1.3 - 3.5 is reasonable.
rotation_penalty
:
5.0
# Penalty to apply to in-place rotations, if minimum control set contains them
retrospective_penalty
:
0.015
lattice_filepath
:
""
# The filepath to the state lattice graph
lookup_table_size
:
20.0
# Size of the dubin/reeds-sheep distance window to cache, in meters.
cache_obstacle_heuristic
:
false
# Cache the obstacle map dynamic programming distance expansion heuristic between subsequent replannings of the same goal location. Dramatically speeds up replanning performance (40x) if costmap is largely static.
allow_reverse_expansion
:
false
# If true, allows the robot to use the primitives to expand in the mirrored opposite direction of the current robot's orientation (to reverse).
smooth_path
:
True
# If true, does a simple and quick smoothing post-processing to the path
