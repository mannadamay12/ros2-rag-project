## World Geometry Monitor
The world geometry monitor builds world geometry using information from the sensors on the robot such as LIDARs or depth cameras and from user input.
It uses theoccupancymapmonitordescribed below to build a 3D representation of the environment around the robot and augments that with information on theplanning_scenetopic for adding object information.

## 3D Perception
3D perception in MoveIt is handled by theoccupancymapmonitor.
The occupancy map monitor uses a plugin architecture to handle different kinds of sensor input as shown in the Figure above.
In particular, MoveIt has inbuilt support for handling two kinds of inputs:
Note that you can add your own types of updaters as a plugin to the occupancy map monitor.

## Octomap
The Occupancy map monitor uses anOctomapto maintain the occupancy map of the environment.
The Octomap can actually encode probabilistic information about individual cells although this information is not currently used in MoveIt.
The Octomap can directly be passed into FCL, the collision checking library that MoveIt uses.

## Depth Image Occupancy Map Updater
The depth image occupancy map updater includes its ownself-filter, i.e. it will remove visible parts of the robot from the depth map.
It uses current information about the robot (the robot state) to carry out this operation.
