## Getting Started
If you haven’t already done so, make sure you’ve completed the steps inGetting Startedor ourDocker Guide.
If you followed the Docker Guide, also follow theCreate A Colcon Workspace and Download Tutorialsguide onwards to set up the tutorials.

## Step 1: Launch the Demo and Configure the Plugin


## Step 2: Play with the Visualized Robots
There are four different overlapping visualizations:
The display states for each of these visualizations can be toggled on and off using checkboxes:

## Step 3: Interact with the Kinova Gen 3
For the next steps we will want only the scene robot, start state and goal state:
There should now be two interactive markers. One marker corresponding to the orange colored arm will be used to set the “Goal State” for motion planning and the other marker corresponding to a green colored arm are used to set the “Start State” for motion planning. If you don’t see the interactive markers pressInteractin the top menu of RViz (Note: some tools may be hidden, press“+”in the top menu to add theInteracttool as shown below).
You should now be able to use these markers to drag the arm around and change its orientation. Try it!

## Moving into collision
For this section, hide the planned path and the goal state:
Now, only the Start State (the green colored arm) should be visible.  Try to move the arm into a configuration where two of its links are in collision with each other.  (If you find this difficult, make sure the “Use Collision-Aware IK” checkbox under the Planning tab of the MotionPlanning plugin is un-checked.)  Once you do this, the links that are in collision will turn red.
Now, check the “Use Collision-Aware IK” checkbox, and try again to move two of the links into collision with each other.  When the checkbox is ticked, the IK solver will keep attempting to find a collision-free solution for the desired end-effector pose. When it is not checked, the solver will allow collisions to happen in the solution. The links in collision will always still be visualized in red, regardless of the state of the checkbox.

## Moving out of Reachable Workspace
Note what happens when you try to move an end-effector out of its reachable workspace.
Before moving onto the next section, re-enable the planned path and the goal state:

## Moving Joints or in Null Space
You can use theJointstab to move single joints and the redundant joints of 7-DOF robots. Try moving the “null space exploration” slider as shown in the animation below.

## Step 4: Use Motion Planning with the Kinova Gen 3


## Introspecting Trajectory Waypoints
You can visually introspect trajectories point by point in RViz.
Note: Once you placed your end-effector to a new goal, be sure to runPlanbefore runningPlay– otherwise you’ll see the waypoints for the previous goal if available.

## Plan Cartesian motions
If the “Use Cartesian Path” checkbox is activated, the robot will attempt to move the end effector linearly in cartesian space.

## Executing Trajectories, Adjusting Speed
Clicking “Plan & Execute” or “Execute” after a successful plan will send the trajectory to the robot - in this tutorial, since you usedkinova_demo.launch, the robot is only simulated.
Initially, the default velocity and acceleration are scaled to 10% (0.1) of the robot’s maximum. You can change these scaling factors in the Planning tab shown below, or change these default values in themoveit_configof your robot (injoint_limits.yaml).

## Next Steps


## RViz Visual Tools
Many of the tutorials usemoveit_visual_toolsto step through a demo. Before continuing on to the next tutorials it is a good idea to enable theRvizVisualToolsGui.
From “Panels” menu, select “Add New Panels”. From the menu, select “RvizVisualToolsGui” and click OK. You’ll see the new panel added to RViz.

## Saving Your Configuration
RViz enables you to save your configuration underFile->SaveConfig. You should do this before continuing on to the next tutorials. If you choose to save your configuration under a new name, you can useFile->SaveConfigAsand refer to your configuration file using:
Replaceyour_rviz_config.rvizwith the name of the file you saved tomoveit2_tutorials/doc/tutorials/quickstart_in_rviz/launch/and build the workspace so it can be found.

## Next Tutorial
InYour First MoveIt Project, you will create a C++ program using MoveIt to plan and execute moves.
