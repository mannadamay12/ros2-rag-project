## Install ROS 2 and colcon
MoveIt 2 currently supports multiple versions of ROS.
Install whichever version you prefer.
We primarily support ROS installed on Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 but other methods and platforms may work with small changes to the instructions listed below.
If you are just getting started, we recommend you use the latest stable version of ROS (Jazzy) on Ubuntu 24.04 for the most seamless experience.
It is easy to miss steps when going through the ROS 2 installation tutorial.
If you run into errors in the next few steps, a good place to start is to go back and make sure you have installed ROS 2 correctly.
One that users commonly forget is to source the ROS 2 install itself.
Note to source the version of ROS you installed.

Once you have ROS 2 installed, make sure you have the most up to date packages:

## Create A Colcon Workspace and Download Tutorials
For tutorials you will need to have acolconworkspace setup.

## Download Source Code of MoveIt and the Tutorials
Move into your Colcon workspace and pull the MoveIt tutorials source, where<branch>can be e.g.humblefor ROS Humble, ormainfor the latest version of the tutorials :
Next we will download the source code for the rest of MoveIt:
The import command may ask for your GitHub credentials.
You can just press Enter until it moves on (ignore the “Authentication failed” error).

## Build your Colcon Workspace
First remove all previously installed moveit binaries:
The following will install from Debian any package dependencies not already in your workspace.
This is the step that will install MoveIt and all of its dependencies:
The next command will configure your Colcon workspace:
This build command will likely take a long time (20+ minutes) depending on your computer speed and amount of RAM available (we recommend 32 GB).
If everything goes well, you should see the message “Summary: X packages finished” where X might be 50. If you have problems, try re-checking yourROS Installation.

## Setup Your Colcon Workspace
Source the Colcon workspace:
Optional: add the previous command to your.bashrc:
