## Linking to other Documents and Sections
Sphinx provides the:doc:and:ref:roles forcross-referencing contentand it’s best to stick to them to ensure compatibility with other Sphinx extensions and multi-distro support.
For linking to other documents, you can use the:doc:role like this:Getting Started(:doc:`/doc/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started`). The:ref:role accepts ids that link to explicit targets on a page.
For convenience, we have enabled the Sphinx extensionautosectionlabelwhich creates unique and human-readable reference targets for all sections.
Sections in all documents can be linked by providing the document path and the section titlelike this(:ref:`likethis<doc/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started:InstallROS2andColcon>`).
Note that the:doc:role requires absolute paths to start with a/while theautosectionlabelextension builds:refpath labels without it.

## Referencing the API Documentation
The API pages are generated using Doxygen and not Sphinx which means that:doc:and:ref:roles are not able to find any API pages.
We are usingdoxylinkand the custom:cpp_api:role for generating links to the API pages from symbols.
Here are some examples, take note that some links use titles and some not:
If you are unsure about how to link certain symbols, you can find all Doxygen references inside theMoveIt.tagfile.
The file is located insidebuild/html/api/orbuild/html/<branch>/api/depending on the build type.
